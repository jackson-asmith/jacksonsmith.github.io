Skilled infrastructure engineer with experience in networking, systems administration, and programming. I automate the boring stuff--_like system builds, configurations, and maintenance_--for teams so people can focus things that matter. I write PowerShell and Ruby programs for a variety of users and coordinate with vendors and internal stakeholders to reduce misconfigurations almost 100%.
